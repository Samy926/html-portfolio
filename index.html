    <p>My name is Samy Fouché, I am 22 years old, and I have been passionate about science, mathematics, and physics for as long as I can remember. <br>After completing high school, I chose to further my education by joining a preparatory class for top-tier schools. My journey led me to enroll in the <br> École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay,where I pursued the Saphire program in my undergraduate studies. Currently, I am in the first year of a master's <br> program in electrical engineering.</p>

       <p> My field of study encompasses signal processing, control systems, and artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic journey,  <br>I have gained in-depth knowledge in these fascinating and ever-evolving areas. Signal processing has equipped me with an unde- <br> rstanding of manipulating and interpreting signals, while control systems have opened doors to the dynamics of system control.</p>
        
       <p>At present, I am delving into the exciting challenges of electrical engineering, exploring advanced concepts related to artificial intelligence. <br> My academic background and experiences have allowed me to develop strong analytical and technical skills, nurturing my passion for inno- <br>vation in the electrical domain.</p>
        
       <p>I am enthusiastic about continuing to learn and contribute to the field of electrical engineering, applying my knowledge to solve complex problems and contribute to technological advancement.</p>
